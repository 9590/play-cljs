## Introduction

A ClojureScript library for making games. It uses [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) underneath. You can create a new play-cljs project with the template:

```
boot -d seancorfield/boot-new new -t "play-cljs" -n "hello-world"
```

## Documentation

* Read the source (I know that sucks, but I am in very early stages of development!)
* Check out [the example games](https://github.com/oakes/play-cljs-examples)
* Join the discussion on [r/playcljs](https://www.reddit.com/r/playcljs/)
* Look at this commented example:

```clojure
